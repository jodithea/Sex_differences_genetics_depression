## Analysts
* The analysis protocol was created by Jodi Thomas and the sex-stratified GWAS and genome-wide genotype-by-sex interaction analyses were carried out in each of the cohorts as follows
	* AGDS = Jodi Thomas
	* All Of Us = Jackson Thorp and Pierre Youssef
	* BIONIC = Floris Huider
	* GLAD+ = Rujia Wang
	* Generation Scotland = Popppy Grimes
	* UK Biobank = Jodi Thomas
* Jodi Thomas performed the meta-analyses and most of the downstream statistical and bioinformatics analyses, with MiXeR analyses being carried out by Jackson Thorp.
